Hello World!

It's Tommaso Papini here, aka Oddlord. I'm an Italian computer scientist "fresh" from University and I'm currently pursuing my biggest passion: Game Development!

I say here "fresh" (between quotation marks) from University as I actually got my master's degree in 2016 and then decided to give a try to academic career, so I got accepted into a PhD in Smart Computing, only to realise an year later that research is not really my ideal occupation. So I dropped out and I started dedicating myself completely to the world of Game Development.

I soon realised that this world is way more complex - and competitive - than I expected. Being a very sought after career, becoming a game developer seems like a not-so-easy task, especially considering that my University was very scientific oriented and didn't offer any course for Game Development.

That's why I've started, in these last months, to learn as much as possible and master the many skills required. I started with learning [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), which led me to the development of a small [multiplayer FPS game](https://github.com/oddlord/unity-multiplayer-fps) (for which I'm sending many thanks to the Youtuber and Game Developer [Brakeys](http://brackeys.com/)). Then I learned the very basics of game development in [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and developed a [Drop7 clone](https://github.com/oddlord/html5-js-drop7), i.e. a copy of the popular game [Drop7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop7) for smartphones, made completely from scratch. During the way, I also enjoyed learning the basics of free graphic programs such as [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). I must admit, looking at all the things that I still have to learn, it might seem daunting, but I had so much fun so far, that I can't wait for more!

For now, my current strategy will be to keep learning new things as much as I can. I might even venture into the terrifying world of [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). Ideally, I would like to produce many small projects, in order to master all the different skill and to achieve so, a good resource might be participating to as many Game Jams as possible. Then, after this summer has passed, I'm thinking about enrolling to some University course for Game Development.

Well this looks like the beginning of a big journey. To all of you that are following (or will follow) my progress, I thank you for reading this.

Stay tuned!

Tommaso
