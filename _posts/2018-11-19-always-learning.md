Hello everyone! Finally I'm back from the dead to tell you a bit of what I've been doing, and especially learning, these past few months!

<!--more-->

Here I am again, after months of not updating this blog. This doesn't mean, however, that I didn't work on Game Development at all. All the contrary!
The truth is that I've been busy with many things to deal in my life, such as moving, that I never found the time to update my progress here. I know.. my fault...

Anyway, what I wanted to say with this post is that what I've been doing lately is widening my knowledge in Game Development, pushing my boundaries by learning new tools instead of just keep on using what I was comfortable with (Unity). And what I decided to focus on was, of course, the other BIG game engine out there, [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4), as well of some more in depth knowledge of the technology of games with [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL).

I wanted to try Unreal Engine first because I've always known that the two big engines for Game Development out there are Unity and Unreal and, since I already had my fair share of Unity basics (see Dreameaters), I decided it was time to go for Unreal. And I must say, I still quite conflicted. If you ask me now, I probably couldn't say which is the best (for me, that is). Scripting-wise I would probably choose Unity, as an higher level programming language such as C# is usually what I prefer in general (compared to something more lower level-ish as C++). Editor wise, I must say that both Unity and Unreal Engines are very good and, for now, I can't complain about anything in particular for neither of them. What I did like about Unreal Engine is the support for blueprints which, in my opinion, can let you achieve certain things way faster than with just C++ code. And of course, Unreal Engine has, in general, a better graphical look, but that's not necessarily a weak point of Unity for me, being a big fan of minimalistic styles such as the low-poly. In the end, I made a bit of experience of all the basic features of Unreal and also made a super small 3D puzzle game, where you had to unlock the door by pushing some trigger with the furniture in the room. At the moment I'm not gonna add it to the portfolio, as it is more of a prototype than a real game. Maybe in the future I'll expand on it and make it into a proper game.

After that, I decided I wanted to go even deeper and learn some more technicalities about videogames. That's when I started learning OpenGL. And boy, is that interesting! There's lot's of mathematics, in particular linear algebra, of course, but learning how to manipulate data in order to draw things on a screen pixel by pixel in order to make things look 3D... is just amazing! Hard as well, I must admit. Sometimes it took me more that I care to admit to wrap my head around a certain topic. But once I understood something, everything suddenly made sense! So far I've learned the very basics: how to create basic shapes, how to modify them (translation, scaling and rotation), how to project them into a 3D space and how to change the view depending on the camera position (with support for keyboard movement). After that, I started studying some more advanced stuff, such as lighting (ambient, diffused, point and spot lighting) and shadow mapping as well. For now I just finished learning all these concepts and as I said, it's been super cool! Maybe in the future I might even develop some small game entirely in OpenGL and C++!

And this is all for now. I actually worked on something else, a new game I made in Unity, but I'll leave that to another post.

Cheers!

Tom
