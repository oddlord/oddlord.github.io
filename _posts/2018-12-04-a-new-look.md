Hello again! Today I want to briefly talk about my website's new look!

<!--more-->

As you can probably already see, I've updated the website look, making it more slick and stylish.

The theme I've used is the [Forty theme](https://html5up.net/forty), from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net), and in particular I've modified the [Jekyll adaptation](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/forty-jekyll-theme) of the theme made by [Andrew Banchich](https://github.com/andrewbanchich).

I'm really happy about the new look of the website, from the palette colour to the responsive layout! I've also added dedicated pages for the games in my portfolio, in order to convey better the essential information about my games. Also, I've added my updated CV to the website, in case somebody would be interested in my professional and academic career and my other achievements.

Till next time!

Tommaso
