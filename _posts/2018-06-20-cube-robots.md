Hello everyone! It's me again, Tommaso, a.k.a. Oddlord. I know I haven't wrote anything in almost two months, but I've been quite busy. Today I wanna tell you about my latest "artistic" achievement: cube robots!

<!--more-->

After my first few videogame projects (mostly tutorials and prototypes) I realised that I needed some proper skill about 3D modelling. So I started following a very useful online tutorial on Blender by [Blender Guru](https://www.blenderguru.com/) and after that, I decided to test my skills and, mostly, my artistic side.

My main motivation was to create a 3D model of a robot in order to add my personal touch to the [Multiplayer FPS](https://github.com/oddlord/unity-multiplayer-fps) prototype I made, since I did it following an online tutorial and using 3rd party free assets. I'm no artist and my Blender skills are still pretty rudimentary, so the idea was to make something simple but still quite nice and cute. I took inspiration by several robots designs online, merging them together as I saw fit. After many trials and errors, the result was the following:

So yeah, nothing epic, but I'm pretty proud of it, being the first 3D model I made entirely by myself, design included. And yes, I also made a couple of basic animations, since my initial goal was to include it into the FPS game. I had to change my mind about that, though, as the model I made and the previous one were pretty different in structure (which was totally my bad for not having though about it at the beginning) and importing it would have been a hell. For now, I prefer to focus on expanding my portfolio and I can use the robot model in some other future game anyway.

Last but not least, one month ago I found a job and moved to London! I am a C++ developer in [Amadeus](http://www.amadeus.com), a company that develops software for travel companies, such as airports, airlines or travel agencies. Working there is really nice so far and I get to improve my skills with C++, which is nice for game development anyway.

In the near future, I'm still pondering whether applying for a MSc course in Game Development or not. We'll see.

'Till next time!

Tommaso
