Hello everyone! And happy 2019 to you all! Today I'm here to talk about my latest game, Whack-A-Mole AR.

Whack-A-Mole AR is, as the name suggests, a remaster of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole but reimagined for Augmented Reality.

For those who don't know, [Whac-A-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole) is a very popular arcade game where the player has to hit with a hammer as many moles as they can as soon as they come out of the respective hole, before they go into hiding again. The first versions of the arcade games were physical, with an actual hammer and actual plastic moles coming out of the holes, while later digital versions of the game were issued.

With this version of the game, I wanted to bring the moles back to life and making this game more realistic and engaging as it once was. The idea is to use a tracking image (shown below) depicting a simple grassy area with several mole holes in it. Such tracking image could be used on screen (using a second device) or printed, for a better and more immersive effect.

As soon as the image is scanned by the AR application the tracking image comes to life and several cute moles start coming out from the holes. The player has then to hit as many moles as they can, scoring more and more points, before the time runs out!

To develop this game I chose to use an AR dedicated application, called [Zapworks Studio](https://zap.works), developed by [Zappar](https://www.zappar.com/). Zapworks Studio is quite a nice tool to use to develop Augmented Reality experiences, as it provides out-of-the-box image training and tracking software and the possibility to script the game through Javascript.

This was just an experiment, trying to develop a small game in a different format (Augmented Reality) and using a different tool (Zapworks Studio). For my future games I think I might stick to more commercial tools, such as Unity or UE4, but it was a fun game to make nonetheless.

May the mole be with you!
