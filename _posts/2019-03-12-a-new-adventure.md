Hello everyone! I'm back again to tell you about the beginning of my new adventure, my new job as a Game Developer!

<!--more-->

That's it, my strenuous search for a new job in the Game Development industry, started a few months back, has finally reached its end. I am now officially employed as a fully fledged Game Developer at GripAble.

[GripAble](http://www.gripable.co/) is a new company, born from researchers at Imperial College in London, that aims to revolutionise the industry of hand and arm rehabilitation by employing a brand new, motion-based controller to play a series of specifically built games for patients that are in need of such kind of treatments. The idea is to make the rehabilitation more easy and accessible and, at the same time, more engaging for the patients themselves.

At GripAble I have the main role of Unity Developer but I also participate in the phases of Game Design, UI design and testing. Having found a Game Development job as a Unity Developer fills me with even more joy as I personally came to favour this framework more than others, since I began to go down the path of Game Development.

I joined GripAble just a week ago, at the beginning of March, so maybe it's still to early to say, but so far I've been shocked by how more motivated and passionate I feel about this job compared to my other jobs. Maybe it's the Game Development, maybe it's the start-up vibe that makes everything new and exciting, or maybe are my new coworkers, equally passionate and driven. I'm not sure, but so far, I'm lovin' it!

Apart from that, I'm still planning to work on my own games in my free time, as I have a couple of ideas I'm just dying to implement. Lately I've been busy with a small side project of mine involving my Raspberry Pi board and a webserver idea I had in mind, but I hope to return to my indie gamedev as soon as possible.

To all of you who supported me, while my dream of becoming a Game Developer was still just a dream, I thank you with all my heart.

Till next time!

Tommaso
