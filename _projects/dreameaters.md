Dreameaters is a multiplayer FPS of dreameating ghosts.

You play as a little ghost, eager to eat the dreams of some sleepy victim. Unfortunately tonight's feast has been targeted not by you only, but by other dreameating ghosts as well. So it's survival of the fittest! Only the last ghost standing will eat! Blast the other ghosts with your ethereal laser and until you're the only one standing!

This game is a 3D multiplayer FPS, with up to 4 player joining a room, killing each other inside a huge bedroom arena. The game supports player accounts and player statistics tracking.
