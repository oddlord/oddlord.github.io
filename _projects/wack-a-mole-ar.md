Wack-A-Mole AR is an Augmented Reality 3D remaster of the classic game Wack-A-Mole.

In this game, the area is composed of several holes on the ground, from which several moles will periodically appear for a short period of time. The goal is to hit as many moles as possible before they hide inside the holes again!

As soon as the game starts, the player has 30 seconds to score as many points as possible. Each regular mole will award 10 points to the player, while the elusive golden mole will award 100 points! Moles will pop up less frequently and stay up for longer at the beginning, but as the player scores more and more points the game will become more and more frenetic.
