Asteroids 3D is a 3D remaster of the arcade classic Asteroids.

In this frenetic and fast-paced game the player controls a spaceship in an area filled with asteroids of various sizes and speeds, moving in random directions. The only weapon at their disposal: laser guns and thrusters to run away as fast as possible!

The goal of the game is then to survive as long as possible before losing all the available lives, gaining as much points as you can and hoping to set a new record!

The game starts with 3 lives for the player and each 10'000 points have been collected an additional life is earned. Collisions with an asteroid will both break the asteroid and take one player's life. Each time an asteroid is broken, either by player collision or because it got shot, smaller fragments are generated in its stead, moving faster than the original asteroid. The points earned for each asteroid explosion are proportioned to the size of the asteroid of fragment destroyed, where smaller fragments are worth way more points!

This is a top-down 2D game with 3D graphics. The general graphical style is that of low-poly / cartoonish. The music soundtracks, instead, are fast-paced 8bit electronic tracks, to best convey the frenetic and "better-run-and-mash-those-buttons" vibe of this game!
