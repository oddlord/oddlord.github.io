description: At GripAble I've helped develop and maintain a total of 13 games aimed at promoting hand and upper body rehabilitation through repeated movements. Using a bespoke controller build entirely in-house, the GripAble Play, the patients would be able to play through the different GripAble games by applying grip force or rotating the wrist and arm along the 3 axis. One of the main challenges has been helping creating a Unity package to be able to interface with the GripAble Play controller.
