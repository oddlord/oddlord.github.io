description: Windowsill is a GripAble activity that promotes pronation/supination and grip/release for exercise and rehabilitation. Be as accurate as possible as you plant, fertilise and water an array of flowers sitting on the windowsill and try not to spill anything outside of the pots. Earn as much tips as you can before the end of the day! Made with Unity and C#.
