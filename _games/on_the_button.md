caption: Solve challenges with the press of a button
description: On The Button is a GripAble activity that promotes grip/release for exercise and rehabilitation. Choose between the Lights, Music or Maze challenge to play with up to two other players (or the GripAble AI when no one's available). On The Button challenges are focused on training cognitive skills. In Lights, each player needs to press their corresponding button when their light turns on. In Music, player will need to memorise a melody and try to play it back. In Maze, players need to guide a frog through a maze of lily pads to reach its goal. Matchmaking is completely transparent for the user, so that they can simply choose a challenge and be automatically put in the next available game with other players (or GripAble bots while waiting for players).
