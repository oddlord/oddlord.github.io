description: Ghost Hunters is a GripAble activity that promotes grip/release for exercise and rehabilitation. Hordes of ghosts will swarm different cities around the world and it's your duty - and your friends' - to kill as many as you can. Play online with old friends or new players, or play solo together with the GripAble AI. Cooperate as you work together towards killing all ghosts on each level, especially the stronger boss ghosts, which will require the both players to shoot at the right moment; but compete against your friends too, comparing the numbers of ghosts killed by each at the end of each level. Ghost Hunters is the multiplayer spiritual successor of Pigeon Hunter, an earlier GripAble activity.
