description: I love experimenting with new technologies or game ideas in my spare time. I've made several game prototypes and technical demos over the last years, mainly in Unity but sometimes giving other technologies a change (e.g. Unreal Engine, OpenGL). Check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://oddlord.itch.io">Itch.io</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oddlord">GitHub</a> pages to explore some of the stuff I've made.
